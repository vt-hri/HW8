In this homework assignment we will use behavior cloning to learn the robot's policy using image observations.

## Assignment

Your goal is to familiarize yourself with the process of learning a robot policy, and to practice this concept by implementing behavior cloning. 
The robot should learn to reach towards blocks that are randomly placed on the table.
You will complete the following steps:
1. Familiarize yourself with the code. Determine how many demonstrations you need to learn a robot policy from image observations.
2. Train your robot to reach for red blocks that are randomly initialized on the table. Then test your policy on a different distribution (e.g., block color is blue).
4. Modify the get_dataset.py code so that the block color is different in each demonstration. Train your robot to reach for the blocks. Then repeat the previous step by testing the policy to reach for blue blocks. Record your observations about how the data distribution affects the robot's learned behaviors.
